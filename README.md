Key Features:

Sign Recognition: Utilizes sign language gestures to trigger specific actions within the home environment.
Control Commands:
Open/Close Doors and Windows: Users can perform a sign to open or close doors and windows, enhancing ease of access.
Turn On/Off Lights: A designated sign will control the lighting, allowing for quick adjustments based on user needs.
Help Sign: Incorporates a help sign that can activate assistance features, ensuring users can easily request help if needed.
Functionality: The system translates recognized signs into actionable commands, creating a seamless interaction between the user and the home automation system. This integration aims to provide a more independent living experience for PWD.
